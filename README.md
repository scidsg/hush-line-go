This device displays the encoded URL for your main Hush Line app, instructions, and the owner's info. Notably, when the device is plugged in, it acts as a listener for your tip line, pinging its address every minute and reporting when it was last seen. So if your server's availability is impacted, you'll know immediately.

And since this device only points to your main Hush Line app and contains no sensitive data, you don't have to worry if you lose it.
